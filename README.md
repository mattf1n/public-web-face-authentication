# web-face-authentication

## Motivation
The goal of the project was to create a proof-of-concept for website-based facial
authentication. This demo is of a mock HarvardKey login page. Using the computer's
webcam, a photo is taken and matched against the Harvard students database (school
 year 2018-2019). If a match is found, the user "logs into" my.harvard.edu. A
 user can also register a new photo if they are not already in the database.
