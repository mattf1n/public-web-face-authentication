# web-face-authentication

## Motivation
The goal of the project was to create a proof-of-concept for website-based facial
authentication. This demo is of a mock HarvardKey login page. Using the computer's
webcam, a photo is taken and matched against the Harvard students database (school
 year 2018-2019). If a match is found, the user "logs into" my.harvard.edu. A
 user can also register a new photo if they are not already in the database.

## Getting started

### Requirements

Note: we had trouble installing dlib on the CS50 IDE. We recommend downloading the project to your computer and running it there instead.

#### Install all at once


```
$ npm install sqlite3
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Login

You should have redirected to http://localhost:5000/login. You must enable javascript and allow the browser to access your camera for the app to work. Take a picture of yourself by clicking the camera button. If the server recognizes you, it should log you in. If not, you may try again, but it is possible that your face is not in the database or your appearance is too different from your Harvard ID photo. If this is the case, go ahead and click the "register" link below the camera button. If the server recognizes your face, you will be redirected to a welcome page, which will welcome you by name.

## Register

At http://localhost:5000/register, you may fill out the form with your first and last name, then click the camera button to take a picture of yourself. If you don't like your picture, click the little trashcan to reset the camera and take another. Once you're satisfied with your picture, go ahead and click "Register." You will be redirected to the login page. You may also cancel the registration process at any time by clicking the "back to login page" button.

## Welcome

 At http://localhost:5000/welcome, if you got here through the login page, you should see a picture of the my.harvard page and a message welcoming you by name. Otherwise you will be redirected back to the login page. There is nothing to do on this page except log yourself back out.

## Discussion

### Is this login secure?

Nope! You can log in as someone else just by holding a photo of them up to the camera. More advanced facial recognition systems can detect "liveness," depth, blinking, emotion, textures, and other features to verify your face.
